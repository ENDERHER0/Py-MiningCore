Welcome to my GitHub repository! This project is a work in progress and is designed to provide a comprehensive view of Bitcoin Core statistics, with a focus on current and predicted prices.

The program includes a state-of-the-art viewer for Bitcoin Core statistics, which is still under development but will eventually allow users to easily navigate and analyze data. 

In addition, the program will automatically update a CSV sheet every 5 minutes with the latest prices, ensuring that users have access to the most up-to-date information.

But that's not all - the program is also being designed to include an AI that will use the data from the CSV sheet to predict future Bitcoin prices. 

This cutting-edge technology is still in development but is being designed to help users make informed decisions when it comes to investing in Bitcoin.

Whether you're a seasoned Bitcoin investor or just starting, this project is the perfect tool for staying up-to-date on the latest trends and making informed decisions. 

So stay tuned for updates and download it today to start exploring the world of Bitcoin Core!
